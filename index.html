			<h2>Year at Lewis: 4th Year</h2>
			<h2>Lewis major/minor/concentrations: Mathematics  and   Computer Science (Video Game Development)</h2>
			<h2>Reasons for pursuing this degree: I was always good in math and enjoyed it so I thought I would continue. Then once I got to Lewis I decided to learn more about computers as I basically knew nothing. Now, I am able to write video games which I may decide to pursue as it combines both my love more making things and useing math/logic.</h2>

            <h2>Reasons for Taking This Course</h2>
            <p>It is my final project for the basic computer science degree, but also a chance to have another "real-life" expierence with developing a product.</p>

		<section class="job">
            <p>Current/Recent Job</p>
			<p>My most recent job was as an assistent coach for my old high school's JV Boys Volleyball team. I had the responsibility of helping to train a group of young men to better themselves in both the game and their daily lives. I ran practices, stated data, and strategized different lineups.</p>

        <section class="hobbies">
            <h2>Hobbies and Special Interests</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite hobbies besides video games, is to read. Although I have a vast selection of classical literature, my main passion comes in the form of comic books. Ever since high school, I started to collect graphic novels for Batman, Nightwing, Batgirl, John Constantine, Moon Knight and Spider-Man. Now I have a massive shelf filled to the brim even after adding some manual attachments to it. Over the years I also been collecting specific issues that are either visually impressive, key moments in history, or the single issue forms of my favorite stories. The goal would be to eventually get frames for them to be displayed on the walls of my study.

My passion for these stories and the media has driven me down a path where I would someday like to write and draw my own comic books. Of course, the idea is to follow some sort of computer science career, but on the side I want to hone my writing skills on the side. Who knows, I might be able to find a career where I will have to do both. That would be the dream.</p>

            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <p>Last semester I decided to tryout drumming in the Rock Band Ensemble Class. Although I am still very new at it, I enjoy it a lot. I decided to continue to participate this year as well. Hopefully all goes well and we have good performances again as the group is a little different but that just makes things more exciting.</p>
